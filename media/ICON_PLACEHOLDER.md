# Extension Icon Required

This directory needs an `icon.png` file with the following specifications:

- **File name**: `icon.png`
- **Size**: 128x128 pixels
- **Format**: PNG
- **Purpose**: VS Code marketplace and activity bar icon

## Icon Design Suggestions

Since this is a Python extension with JSON-RPC communication:
- Consider using Python-related symbols (snake, Python logo elements)
- Terminal or command-line interface symbols
- VS Code's color scheme for consistency
- Simple, clear design that works at small sizes

## How to Create

1. Design a 128x128 pixel icon using any image editor
2. Save as PNG format
3. Replace this placeholder with `icon.png`

The extension is currently configured to use `media/icon.png` in package.json.
